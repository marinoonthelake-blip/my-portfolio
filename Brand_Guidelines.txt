# Brand Identity: The Digital Engineer

## Core Philosophy
"Utilitarian Elegance." The design should feel like a high-performance code editor: dark, clean, and data-dense.

## Visual Language
1. **Base Theme:** Dark Mode by default.
   - Background: Deep Void (#050505) - Not pure black.
   - Surface: Panel Grey (#111111) - For cards and sidebars.

2. **Accent Strategy:** "Electric Signal"
   - Primary Action: Electric Blue (#0070F3) - Used for buttons and active states.
   - Success: Terminal Green (#00FF94) - Used for data verification.
   - Error: Debug Red (#FF0055) - Used for alerts.

3. **Typography:**
   - Headings: Sans-Serif (Inter or Geist) - Tight tracking, bold weights.
   - Body: Sans-Serif (Inter or Geist) - High legibility.
   - Code/Data: Monospace (JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) - Used for the "Experience Timeline" and data metrics.

4. **Layout & Spacing:**
   - 4px Grid System (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64).
   - Sharp corners (0px radius) or minimal rounding (4px) to emphasize technical precision. No pill shapes.

5. **Motion Guidelines (For Choreographer Reference):**
   - Transitions should be "Snappy" (0.2s ease-out-quart).
   - No bouncy springs. Movement should feel mechanical and precise.
